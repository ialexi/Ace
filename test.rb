# A CSSParser object is created for every file processed. It opens the file,
# reads its contents, and can perform two actions on it: parsing and generating.
#
# The parsing step reads the file and finds references to images; this causes those
# images to be added to the object's usedImages, which is a set of images required (images
# here being hashes with arguments specified). Ruby's "Set" functionality seems
# to work here (I am not a ruby expert, hence 'seems')
# 
# Internally, it actually generates an in-memory CSS file in the parsing step,
# to be used in the generating stepâ€”but that's all transparent. The object is long-lived,
# staying around from initial parse step to generation.
